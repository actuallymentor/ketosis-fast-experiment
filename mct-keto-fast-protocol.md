# MCT only fast

This page describes the experimentation protocol we're using for a 5 day (120 hour) fast. Strictly speaking this is not a pure fast since we will be consuming calories. The rationale for this experiment is to attempt to develop a fast-like protocol that brings the body into ketosis deeply and sustainably for the purpose of longevity.

Inspiration for this experiment are the ketosis research by Dom D'Agostino and the fast-mimicking diet developed by dr Valter Longo.

Abreviations:

- MCT, medium chain triglycerides
- C8 MCT, MCT of C8 length, in this protocol specifically caprylic acid with a caloric value of 899 kCal per 100 grams
- BHB, beta-hydroxybutyrate

## Basic protocol

Materials:

- Abbott Precision Optium Neo ([link to manufacturer](https://www.myfreestyle.com/freestyle-precision-neo-blood-glucose-monitoring-devices)) with BHB strips ([amazon link](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Optium-Beta-Ketone-Test-Strips/dp/B005DPSNOC))
- C8 MCT oil ([amazon link](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B01M12RE4D))

Rationale: the Optium Neo is a consumer accessible device with compatible ketone strips. No other devices were considered. The C8 oil was chosen based on research indicating that it is the most effective oil for reaching and maintaining ketosis.

Measurements:

- BHB & glucose (fasted) 1h after waking
- BHB & glucose 6h after waking (1h after MCT)

Rationale: having a baseline fasted measurement and a measurement in the digestion window of the MCT oil. Ideally one would test more, but we considered the cost of BHB strips prohibitive for more than 2 tests a day.

Consumption:

- 20g MCT 1 hour after waking (after fasted HB measurement)
- 20g MCT 3 hours after waking
- 20g MCT 5h after waking (1h before second measurement)
- 20g MCT 8h after waking
- 20g MCT 11h after waking
- 10g MCT 14h after waking

Rationale: a maximum total of 1000 kCal a day as prescribed by doctor Longo's fast mimicking diet approach comes down to about 111 grams of our C8 MCT.

No significant calories will be consumed from any source other than C8 medium chain triglyceride oil.

## Non-caloric consumption

Aside from MCT oil the following may be consumed ad libitum:

- Coffee (no sugar, milk or other caloric additives)
- Tea (no sugar, milk or other caloric additives)
- Water
